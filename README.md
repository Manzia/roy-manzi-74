============
Contains Java code for the backend of an iOS consumer electronics shopping app that I built. The iOS code is my other repo: roy-manzi-75.
The central idea behind the application was to allow users to search for products using "qualitative" queries. This idea came to me when my sister one day asked me to buy her a laptop that was "small and can fit in my handbag" and my girlfriend asked me for a "small, cute phone". The goal of the app was to enable non-technical people search for electronics products using qualitative search terms like "small, fast, attractive, light, etc."

MzShoppingReleaseFinal Project:
- pulls product data from the BestBuy Remix API
- receives and processes "qualitative" product queries from user devices
- uses product review data to qualitatively rank products given a "qualitative" query
- returns the top-ranked product results to the user device.
